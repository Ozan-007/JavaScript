//IMMEDIATE FUNCTIONS


// function welcome(name) {
    
//     let days = ["Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday",'Friday',"Saturday"];
    
//     let date = new Date().getDay();
    
//     console.log(`Welcome ${name} today is ${days[date]}.`)
// }

// welcome("Ozan");

//!! if we want to use a function and we want it to work just one time, We don't have to waste time on naming it and calling it etc. We can simply use ↓↓↓ 

// Immediate


// (function(name) {
    
//     let days = ["Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday",'Friday',"Saturday"];
    
//     let date = new Date().getDay();

//     console.log(`Hello ${name} today is ${days[date]}`)

// }("James")) // This is why they are called immediate functions...
